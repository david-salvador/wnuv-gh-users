# WnuvGhUsers

This project exercises the Github API to search users by login 





## Welcome to the wnuv-gh-users wiki!

A web application in Angular 5.2 that consumes Github API

# Requirements:
1. There must be a search bar to let the user search by username (login name)
1. After the search is completed, the application displays the list of users along with their avatar and their username on the same page
1. When a list item is clicked, the application navigates to a new page that displays a simple list with all the user 
 details.
1. The new page will also display the list of the user's repositories and followers.
1. The application has to be responsive and optimized for mobile
1. Documentation on how the application works and how to set up and build the project must be provided
1. The search input does the searching as you type (See google search as an example)
1. There is animated transition between pages
1. The application supports theming and can easily be switched between themes
1. The application style is built using Bootstrap v4
1. All pages' URL is reusable - meaning it can be copied and pasted on different browser and still shows the same result
